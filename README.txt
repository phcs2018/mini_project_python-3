In this short assignment, you'll write a simple  Python script to find valid
credit card numbers in a file 'ccnumbers.txt' using regular expressions.

A valid credit card number is defined as either one of:

1) 4 groups of 4 numbers, each group separated by a '-'

e.g. 1234-1234-1234-1234

2) A string of 16 digits: 

e.g. 1234123412341234

How to run this script:

python find_cc_regex.py -F <input file>

Your task is to complete the missing code in find_cc_regex.py
